```bash
dart pub get
```
To get started, import the library:
```dart
import 'package:dartframe/dartframe.dart';
```
For detailed examples and usage, please refer to the documentation in the `doc` folder and the examples in the `example` folder.

## Performance and Scalability

DartFrame is optimized for small to medium-sized datasets. While not designed for big data processing, it can handle thousands of rows efficiently in memory. For larger datasets, consider integrating with distributed processing tools or databases.

---

## Testing

Tests are located in the test directory. To run tests, execute dart test in the project root.

---

## Benchmarking

Performance benchmarks are available in the `benchmark` directory. These benchmarks, built using the `benchmark_harness` package, help measure the performance of various operations on `Series` and `DataFrame` objects.

For detailed instructions on how to run these benchmarks and interpret their output, please see [benchmark/BENCHMARKING.MD](./benchmark/BENCHMARKING.md).

Reference (simulated) performance numbers can be found in [benchmark/RESULTS.MD](./benchmark/RESULTS.md).
